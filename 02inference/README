Prerequisite:
    * sampled alignments generated in previous step (directory sampled/)
    * MATLAB
    * modified plmDCA (included in ./maelaplmdca)

Procedure:
    1. (before first use) Edit 00runplmdca.py
        * Set the path to your MATLAB executable
        * Set the desired number of cores to use, or use -1 for the program to use
            all available cores
        * Set the absolute path to the ./maelaplmdca directory

    2. For each of the alignments, run ./00runplmdca.py. Preferably on a 
        computational cluster.

        Example:
        $> for t in sampled/sampling*/maela.seq; do ./00runplmdca.py $t; done
        
    3. Wait until inference finishes -- may take a considerable amount of time.
