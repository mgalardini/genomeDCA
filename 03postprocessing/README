Prerequisite:
    * sampled alignments generated in previous step (directory sampled/)
    * files with couplings inferred in previous step (each directory should
        contain files: maela.seq, maela.mapping and maela.plmdca)

Procedure:
    1. (optional) In ./00process.py uncomment one of the bottom lines,
        to enable compression (recommended) or deletion (not recommended)
        of output files.

    2. For each of directories with inferred couplings, run ./00process.py

        Example:
        $> for t in sampled/sampling*; do ./00process.py $t; done

        You can do it while the inferrence on some of the samples is ongoing,
        in the interest of saving disk space

    3. Whenever you want to see the summary statistics, run ./01summary.py in
        the ./sampled/ directory.
        (Can be run with incomplete data). 
        Produces ./summarytable.txt file, with following syntax:

        |       |        \- mean coupling value
        |       \- locus/site 2
        \- locus/site 1

        Site pairs which consistently score high (high mean, low standard deviation, number of times 
        sampled equal or almost equal to number of combinations) are likely to be true couplings
