Procedure:
    1. Procure aligned genome sequences (e.g. maela3k.fasta)
    2. Prepare an input file, containing the summary statistics, 
       counting the number of occurences of individual allelles 
       at given positions:
        Example:
          12004 3110   10    0    0    0   36 0.0000
          |     |       |    |    |    |   |  |
          |     |       |    |    |    |   |  \- Minor allele frequency
          |     |       |    |    |    |   |     (column 2)/(column2+column3)
          |     |       |    |    |    |   \- gap count
          |     |       |    |    |    \- Sanity check - count of letters other than [ACGTN] 
          |     |       |    |    |                      (should be zero)
          |     |       |    |    \- Count of least common allele
          |     |       |    \- Count of third most common allele 
          |     |       \- Count of second most common allele (minor allele), should be non zero
          |     \- Count of most common allele
          \- Position index
    3. Filter the resultant file, to exclude positions that are non bi-allelic, 
       have too low MAF (minor alllele frequency) or too many gaps (00filterstats.py)
    4. Encode the results into a pickled Python dictionary for fast access (02encode.py)
